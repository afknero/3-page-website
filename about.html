        <h3>Why This Project?</h3>
        <div>
          Voting is one of the most important ways we can shape our future, but
          many young people feel disconnected. Through this project, I want to
          dive into the reasons why Gen Z isn't showing up at the polls.

        <h3>Gen Z and Politics</h3>
        <div>
          Despite being the most connected generation, Gen Z faces unique
          challenges in political engagement. We'll explore the disconnect
          between civic education, social media, and actual voting behavior.

        <h3>Proposed Solutions</h3>
        <div>
          It's time to rethink how we talk about voting. From down-ballot races
          to local issues, I'll offer solutions that might inspire Gen Z to see
          voting as a tool for change rather than a chore.
